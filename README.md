## Setup the programm

1. Clone this repo.

```git bash
git clone https://github.com/Boniker/Covid-19-Detection-and-Alalysis-using-CT-Lungs-Images
```

2. Download model and place it in following structure. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NNv4gDDr3-AP4wTaKoN4WcmcOyDYWvi-?usp=sharing

  |__GUI Application
    |__proposed-CB-STM-RENet-model
      |__Proposed_CB_STM_RENet.mat
```

4. Check do you have a datasheet inside COVID-X-ray-test-images directory.

5. I have created two different GUI interfaces

```text
1. Segmentation GUI (using threshold, interactive)
2. Main Detection GUI interface
```

6. Run code, or setup the GUI interface.
